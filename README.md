# Table Understanding
This is the official repository of:
+ [TUTA:Tree-based Transformers for Generally Structured Table Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12537) 
+ [ForTaP:Using Formulae for Numerical-Reasoning-Aware Table Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07323).

TUTA is a unified pretrained model for understanding generally structured tables. 

Based on TUTA, ForTaP further endows the model with stronger numerical-reasoning skills by pretraining on spreadsheet formulas.
